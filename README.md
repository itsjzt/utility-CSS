# utility-CSS
> A minimal CSS library that consists of small classes to make modern components of your website.

## Why we made this [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

It started with a plan to make a CSS library that is highly reusable and immutable at the core. Instead of looking for the fancy features like modals and dropdowns. We tried to make something is easy to integrate into projects. It is so small that you can learn the whole library in minutes (look at [Cheatsheet](docs/classes-cheatsheet.md)).


## Getting Started

**CDN: https://gitcdn.xyz/repo/itsjzt/utility-CSS/master/build/utility.css**

At the core our library is just bunch of classes for simple CSS properties like padding, margin, font size etc. We compose them together to form a component like this button below:

```html
<button class="-px-lg -py-sm -bg-info -txt-white -no-bd -h-shadow">Button</button>
```
![button](docs/imgs/button.png)

looking at the classes you will get that they are short names of common CSS properties like `-px-lg` for padding large on the X axis and `-bg-info` for background denoting info message (Colors inspired from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)).
