> A minimal CSS library for making components with composition of common CSS properties

We don't intended to make fancy logos, unique name or super-duper website we wanted to ship the code so you can use play with it, used it in projects with help of [docs](docs/getting-started.md) and we did it with our alpha release (0.0.1).

We are different from other conventional CSS frameworks out there, we wanted to write specific CSS styles  (1 - 2 line of CSS for 1 class) and make them globally re-usable.

We don't have a button to show you how cool our library looks, but we can use composition of our css classes to make thousands of button styles.

```html
<button class="-px-lg -py-sm -bg-info -txt-white -bd-none -h-shadow">Button</button>
```
![button](docs/imgs/button.png)

looks a lot of classes but wait they are super reusable and easy don't contradict with other classes because they can be composed easily.
